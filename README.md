# Roll Call Game Scheduler for Tabletop Role-playing Games

This project is a web appliaction that allows people to keep track of their scheduled game nights and to see at a glance who is available and who isn't. 

## Main Features

 - Each user will log into the application using a Discord account and will have a list of games they've either created or joined. 
 - Each game displays a title, the next scheduled date, and the players participating. Players can join a given game if they are given an invite link from the game's creator. 
 - Each player will be highlighted red or green to show whether or not they're available, or not highlighted if they haven't confirmed. 
 - Eveyone in the game will be able to see the status of all players update in real time. 

## Aditional Features

When the web app itself is completed I plan on adding a function where the creator of the game can associate a Discord server with it, and have a bot join that server to regularly send reminders about the upcoming game, and to remind players to confirm if they are available.

## Technology

This app is being created using Gatsby/React/Material-UI on the frontend while using NodeJS with Netlify Serverless functions and Firebase for the backend.

## Current Stage:

Working on front-end functionality.
